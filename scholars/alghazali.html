        <p>
          Al-Ghazali was one of the most prominent and influential philosophers,
          theologians, jurists, and mystics of Sunni Islam. He is known for his
          works on jurisprudence and philosophy.
        </p>

        <p>
          His notable work, “The Incoherence of the Philosophers,” critiqued the
          ideas of Greek-influenced philosophers. He arguied that some of their
          views contradicted Islamic teachings. This work profoundly impacted
          Islamic philosophy, sparking discussions on the interplay between
          reason and revelation.
        </p>

        <p>
          Al-Ghazali’s philosophical explorations prompted a personal spiritual
          transformation, documented in his autobiography, “Deliverance from
          Error.” Known as the “Proof of Islam,” Al-Ghazali’s influence extended
          to theology, mysticism, and jurisprudence.
        </p>

        <p>
          His integration of Sufi mysticism with orthodox Islam contributed to a
          more balanced religious approach. All in all, his emphasis on the
          inner dimensions of faith and the harmonious relationship between
          reason and revelation made him a revered figure in Islamic
          intellectual history.
